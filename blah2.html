<p>As season one began, the Baratheons and Lannisters ruled together. King Robert Baratheon was married to Queen Cersei Lannister. But a problem soon arose. It turned out that Cersei was having an affair with her twin brother, Jaime Lannister — and that all of Robert's supposed children, including his heir, Joffrey, were actually fathered by Jaime. To keep this from becoming known, Cersei arranged Robert's murder and crowned teenager Joffrey king. His army is made up of Lannister forces, and his lead adviser is his grandfather, Tywin Lannister — the true ruler of Westeros.</p>

<p>Mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher Walter White thinks his life can't get much worse.

But Walter is dumbstruck when he learns he has terminal cancer. Realizing that his illness probably will ruin his family financially, Walter makes a desperate bid to earn as much money as he can in the time he has left by turning an old RV into a meth lab on wheels.</p>
